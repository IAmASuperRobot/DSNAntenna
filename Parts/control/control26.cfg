	description = The KIPSAT DSN Control Hub, where big dreams meet even bigger dishes! This hub is the brains behind the brawn, making sure our 26-meter reflector stays pointed in all the right directions. It's got more algorithms than you can shake a Kerbal at, and enough redundancy to make even the most cautious engineers smile. When it comes to tracking and transmitting, this hub's got your back!
