	description = The KIPSAT DSN Control Hub XL - the brainiac in charge of the 34-meter wonder dish! This hub commands respect with more algorithms than a rocket has boosters. It's got backup plans for its backup plans, making sure your signals never get lost in space. When it comes to communication, this hub doesn't just go big, it goes XL!
