	description = Behold the KIPSAT 26m Deep Space Network Reflector - where big talkers meet even bigger dishes! This 26-meter giant is more than just a pretty parabola, it's your ticket to shouting across the Kerbal system like you're chatting with your next-door neighbor. Built tough enough to survive a Kerbin winter (figuratively speaking, of course), this reflector is ready to take your comms game to the next level!
