# Kerbal Interplanetary Probes Presents: **KIPSAT DSN Antennas**

<!-- <span style="font-family: 'Arial Narrow'; font-size: 5em; color: red;">**KIPSAT DSN Antennas**</span> -->

## Description

This is a work-in-progress mod for Kerbal Space Program (KSP) that aims to add large Deep Space Network (DSN) satellite dishes to enhance long-range communication capabilities.

## Features

- Provides three DSN satellite dishes of increasing size, designed to match the default KSP DSN network antenna power settings.
- It is designed to work with the **extra groundstation to OFF**, otherwise there is no real point :). Therefore increasing he challenge of long-rage communications.
- Requires a significant budget and attention to launchpad upgrades, introducing a new level of challenge to the game.

## About

- This is my first attempt at creating a mod, so bear with me as I learn the ropes.
- The models and textures are a work in progress and may not meet professional standards yet, but they provide the **basic functionality needed for the mod to work**.

## Dependencies

- It is highly recommended, if not necessary, to have the [Hyperdit Mod](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/34785-112-hyperedit-v158-july-10-2018-cheat-teleporter-orbitplanet-editor-more/) installed for optimal performance and compatibility.

## Installation

1. Download the mod ZIP file from the [releases page](https://github.com/IAmASuperRobot/DSNAntenna/releases).
2. Unzip the downloaded file to get the mod folder.
3. Place the mod folder in the `GameData` directory of your Kerbal Space Program installation.


## Known Issues

- Known for now :)

## Contributing

- Any wishes to contribute/help are welcome

## Wishlist

While this mod is a work in progress, there are several features I'd like to implement in the future to enhance the overall experience:

1. **Improved Textures and Models:** I aim to refine the visual aspects of the satellite dishes, starting with high-quality textures and eventually exploring new 3D models to further enhance their appearance.

2. **Contract Pack for Added Value:** I'm considering the development of a contract pack that integrates with the mod, providing players with additional missions and objectives centered around the DSN satellite dishes.

3. **Integration with Other Mods:** I plan to explore compatibility with popular mods like [RemoteTech](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/139167-111-remotetech-v199-2020-12-19/), enabling a seamless experience for players who wish to incorporate advanced communication systems into their gameplay.

4. **Interior Models:** While not currently implemented, I aspire to eventually introduce interior models for the satellite dishes, adding an extra layer of immersion for players who enjoy detailed spacecraft interiors.

5. **Kerbal Control Requirements:** In the future, I aim to introduce a system where Kerbals must be present to provide manual controls, similar to the functionality offered by the RemoteTech mod.

Please note that these features are part of a wishlist and may be subject to development feasibility and future updates.
